# PodRepeater

## What?

A (prototype) podcast player where you select episodes that should go on repeat and not be removed after you have listened to it.

## Why?

I listen a lot to language learning podcasts, Italian, in fact, and I wanted to repeat the episodes on the level where I currently am.
This was always cumbersome because the assumption most (all?) podcast apps make is that you only want to listen to an episode once.

So I started hacking on a simple JS app to search, list and collect Podcasts and episodes into repeatable lists.

Of course, a work in progress.

## Implementation

This is currently implemented using _Vue_ and _Vuetify_.
To start

    npm run serve
